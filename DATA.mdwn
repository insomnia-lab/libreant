Rationale
===========

You have installed elasticsearch, setup your virtualenv and your python dependencies. Now you want to test it
a bit. Or maybe you want to develop, and need some "lorem ipsum" data. This howto is for you!

HowTo
=====

First of all, make sure that elasticsearch is running.

Then, "enter" your virtualenv. This typically is

```sh
source ve/bin/activate
```

Now run
```sh
curl -s 'http://boyska.s.pt-labs.net/libreant/contrib/colibri.json' 'http://boyska.s.pt-labs.net/libreant/contrib/rabbia/rabbia.json' 'http://boyska.s.pt-labs.net/libreant/contrib/csv2json/info_forte.json' |  webant-manage db_import -
```

This will fetch three sample "libraries" and add every book to your elasticsearch.

Of course you can exclude the ones that you don't like, or create your own.
