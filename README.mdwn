  whatsoever
* ease of deployment

```
###Run

Implementation
==============

Main building blocks are python, elasticsearch, flask.

Testing
=======

There is not much, still. However, after having activated your virtualenv, start
elasticsearch: how to do so depend on your distribution. On debian, it is `sudo service start elasticsearch`.
On systemd-based distribution, it is `sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service`

Now you can run the unit test, using `nosetests -c nose.cfg`

For a more complete testing, wait a bit longer ;)
